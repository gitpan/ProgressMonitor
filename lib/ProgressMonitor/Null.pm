=head1 NAME

ProgressMonitor::Null - a monitor implementation which doesn't render anything.
Useful if a receiver insists on a monitor impl to talk to.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ...
  $someObj->someLongRunningMethod(ProgressMonitor::Null->new);
  ...

  ####
  
  useful pattern inside a method that takes a monitor instance
  but can accept undef for it:
  
  someMethod
  {
    my $monitor = shift;
    
    monitor = ProgressMonitor::Null->new unless $monitor;
    
    ...
    #now the rest of the code is guaranteed a monitor
    ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a 'null' implementation of the ProgressMonitor interface. It will simply
ignore to render anything, thus it's a good dropin for a method that requires
a monitor instance but you don't wish anything shown. 

Inherits from AbstractStatefulMonitor.
