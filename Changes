0.06	2007-04-05
		- Fixed a loophole; if maxwidth not set we must fall back to hardcoded
		  79 unless the Term::Size... stuff returns something worthwhile
		- Added a convenience subMonitor method to the interface; makes it
		  cleaner to instantiate a SubTask monitor
		- Added a setErrorMessage method and associated support
		- Fixed bug where the Bar never indicated empty progress when it was
		  blank
		- Mumbo jumbo with getting stuff printed right when backspacing 
		  before or after - 'backspaceAfterRender'
		  
0.07	2007-04-11
		- Added a clone method to progressmonitors
		- made sure error messages are cleaned from ws
		- set[Error]Message msgs are no longer mangled, but passed right through
		- a msg is passed through as-is if messageStrategy is newline (message filler applied though...should it?)
		
0.08	2007-04-23
		- It's possible to call 'end' directly if no work is needed at all
		  This signals 'completion' of the monitor.
		- Avoid treating a 'begin(0)' the same as 'begin()'
		- Division by zero in some fields when totalTicks is explicitly '0'.
		
0.09	2007-05-09
		- When using an overlay message on a field shorter than the msg, the
		  rendition became longer than its maxwidth
		  
0.10	2007-05-21
		- Removed the setting of ticks == totalTicks at 'end'

0.11	2007-05-25
		- Added a new message strategy - 'overlay_newline'.
